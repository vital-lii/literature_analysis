36170234	FOXP3+ macrophage represses acute ischemic stroke-induced neural inflammation.	Proper termination of cell-death-induced neural inflammation is the premise of tissue repair in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Macrophages scavenge cell corpses/debris and produce inflammatory mediators that orchestrate immune responses. Here, we report that FOXP3, the key immune-repressive transcription factor of Tregs, is conditionally expressed in macrophages in stroke lesion. FOXP3 ablation in macrophages results in detrimental stroke outcomes, emphasizing the beneficial role of FOXP3+ macrophages. FOXP3+ macrophages are distinct from the M1 or M2 subsets and display superactive efferocytic capacity. With scRNAseq and analysis of FOXP3-bound-DNA isolated with CUT & RUN, we show that FOXP3 facilitates macrophage phagocytosis through enhancing cargo metabolism. FOXP3 expression is controlled by macroautophagic/autophagic protein degradation in resting macrophages, while initiation of LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) competitively occupies the autophagic machineries, and thus permits FOXP3 activation. Our data demonstrate a distinct set of FOXP3+ macrophages with enhanced scavenging capability, which could be a target in immunomodulatory therapy against AIS.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; AIF1/Iba1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; AIS: acute ischemic stroke; ARG1: arginase 1; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BECN1/Beclin1: Beclin 1, autophagy related; BMDM: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CKO: conditional knockout; CSF1/M-CSF: colony stimulating factor 1 (macrophage); CSF2/GM-CSF: colony stimulating factor 2; CSF3/G-CSF: colony stimulating factor 3; CUT & RUN: cleavage under targets and release using nuclease; CyD: cytochalasin D; DAMP: danger/damage-associated molecular pattern; DIL: dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylin docarbocyanine; ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; GO: Gene Ontology; FCGR3/CD16: Fc receptor, IgG, low affinity III; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; IFNG/IFN纬: interferon gamma; IP: immunoprecipitation; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; ITGAM/CD11b: integrin subunit alpha M; ITGAX/CD11c: integrin subunit alpha X; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; LC-MS: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MRC1/CD206: mannose receptor, C type 1; O4: oligodendrocyte marker O4; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RBC: red blood cells; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein, fox 1 homolog (C. elegans) 3; RUBCN/Rubicon: RUN domain and cysteine-rich domain containing, Beclin 1-interacting protein; scRNAseq: single cell RNA sequencing; SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1); TGFB/TGF尾: transforming growth factor, beta; tMCAO: transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF/TNF伪: tumor necrosis factor; Treg: regulatory T cell.

34051364	Immune responses to injury and their links to eye disease.	The eye is regarded as an immune privileged site. Since the presence of a vasculature would impair vision, the vasculature of the eye is located outside of the central light path. As a result, many regions of the eye evolved mechanisms to deliver immune cells to sites of dysgenesis, injury, or in response to the many age-related pathologies. While the purpose of these immune responses is reparative or protective, cytokines released by immune cells compromise visual acuity by inducing inflammation and fibrosis. The response to traumatic or pathological injury is distinct in different regions of the eye. Age-related diseases impact both the anterior and posterior segment and lead to reduced quality of life and blindness. Here we focus attention on the role that inflammation and fibrosis play in the progression of age-related pathologies of the cornea and the lens as well as in glaucoma, the formation of epiretinal membranes, and in proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

23774107	Innate and adaptive immunity in inflammatory bowel disease.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The exact cause of IBD remains unknown. Available evidence suggests that an abnormal immune response against the microorganisms of the intestinal flora is responsible for the disease in genetically susceptible individuals. The adaptive immune response has classically been considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, recent advances in immunology and genetics have clarified that the innate immune response is equally as important in inducing gut inflammation in these patients. In particular, an altered epithelial barrier function contributes to intestinal inflammation in patients with UC, while aberrant innate immune responses, such as antimicrobial peptide production, innate microbial sensing and autophagy are particularly associated to CD pathogenesis. On the other hand, besides T helper cell type (Th)1 and Th2 immune responses, other subsets of T cells, namely Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells, are likely to play a role in IBD. However, given the complexity and probably the redundancy of pathways leading to IBD lesions, and the fact that Th17 cells may also have protective functions, neutralization of IL-17A failed to induce any improvement in CD. Studying the interactions between various constituents of the innate and adaptive immune systems will certainly open new horizons in the knowledge about the immunologic mechanisms implicated in gut inflammation.

31286804	New insights into the interplay between autophagy, gut microbiota and inflammatory responses in IBD.	One of the most significant challenges of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research is to understand how alterations in the symbiotic relationship between the genetic composition of the host and the intestinal microbiota, under impact of specific environmental factors, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for disease management.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AIEC: adherent-invasive <i>Escherichia coli</i>; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATG: autophagy related; <i>Atg16l1[螖IEC]</i> mice: mice with <i>Atg16l1</i> depletion specifically in intestinal epithelial cells; <i>Atg16l1[HM]</i> mice: mice hypomorphic for <i>Atg16l1</i> expression; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CASP: caspase; CD: Crohn disease; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; CHUK/IKKA: conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase; CLDN2: claudin 2; DAPK1: death associated protein kinase 1; DCs: dendritic cells; DSS: dextran sulfate sodium; EIF2A: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERBIN: Erbb2 interacting protein; ERN1/IRE1A: ER to nucleus signaling 1; FNBP1L: formin binding protein 1-like; FOXP3: forkhead box P3; GPR65: G-protein coupled receptor 65; GSK3B: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IECs: intestinal epithelial cells; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; IL10R: interleukin 10 receptor; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; ISC: intestinal stem cell; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MIF: macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MIR/miRNA: microRNA; MTMR3: myotubularin related protein 3; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MYD88: myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; NLRP3: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; NOD2: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2; NPC: Niemann-Pick disease type C; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; OMVs: outer membrane vesicles; OPTN: optineurin; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PRR: pattern-recognition receptor; PTPN2: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2; PTPN22: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid); PYCARD/ASC: PYD and CARD domain containing; RAB2A: RAB2A, member RAS oncogene family; RELA: v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (avian); RIPK2: receptor (TNFRSF)-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SNPs: single nucleotide polymorphisms; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; Th: T helper 1; TIRAP/TRIF: toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein; TLR: toll-like receptor; TMEM173/STING: transmembrane protein 173; TMEM59: transmembrane protein 59; TNF/TNFA: tumor necrosis factor; Treg: regulatory T; TREM1: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1; XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.

33746968	Neutrophils: Many Ways to Die.	Neutrophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are key participants in the innate immune response for their ability to execute different effector functions. These cells express a vast array of membrane receptors that allow them to recognize and eliminate infectious agents effectively and respond appropriately to microenvironmental stimuli that regulate neutrophil functions, such as activation, migration, generation of reactive oxygen species, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and mediator secretion, among others. Currently, it has been realized that activated neutrophils can accomplish their effector functions and simultaneously activate mechanisms of cell death in response to different intracellular or extracellular factors. Although several studies have revealed similarities between the mechanisms of cell death of neutrophils and other cell types, neutrophils have distinctive properties, such as a high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), that are important for their effector function in infections and pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies, influencing their cell death mechanisms. The present work offers a synthesis of the conditions and molecules implicated in the regulation and activation of the processes of neutrophil death: apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, NETosis, and necrosis. This information allows to understand the duality encountered by PMNs upon activation. The effector functions are carried out to eliminate invading pathogens, but in several instances, these functions involve activation of signaling cascades that culminate in the death of the neutrophil. This process guarantees the correct elimination of pathogenic agents, damaged or senescent cells, and the timely resolution of the inflammation that is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis in the organism. In addition, they alert the organism when the immunological system is being deregulated, promoting the activation of other cells of the immune system, such as B and T lymphocytes, which produce cytokines that potentiate the microbicide functions.

24064518	Autophagy in infection, inflammation and immunity.	Autophagy is a fundamental eukaryotic pathway that has multiple effects on immunity. Autophagy is induced by pattern recognition receptors and, through autophagic adaptors, it provides a mechanism for the elimination of intracellular microorganisms. Autophagy controls inflammation through regulatory interactions with innate immune signalling pathways, by removing endogenous inflammasome agonists and through effects on the secretion of immune mediators. Moreover, autophagy contributes to antigen presentation and to T cell homeostasis, and it affects T cell repertoires and polarization. Thus, as we discuss in this Review, autophagy has multitiered immunological functions that influence infection, inflammation and immunity.

29556036	Autophagy during viral infection - a double-edged sword.	Autophagy is a powerful tool that host cells use to defend against viral infection. Double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, deliver trapped viral cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Specifically, autophagy initiates an innate immune response by cooperating with pattern recognition receptor signalling to induce interferon production. It also selectively degrades immune components associated with viral particles. Following degradation, autophagy coordinates adaptive immunity by delivering virus-derived antigens for presentation to T lymphocytes. However, in an ongoing evolutionary arms race, viruses have acquired the potent ability to hijack and subvert autophagy for their benefit. In this Review, we focus on the key regulatory steps during viral infection in which autophagy is involved and discuss the specific molecular mechanisms that diverse viruses use to repurpose autophagy for their life cycle and pathogenesis.

33849389	Augmenting ATG14 alleviates atherosclerosis and inhibits inflammation via promotion of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages.	Dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy in macrophages contributes to atherosclerosis. Impaired autophagy-lysosomal degradation system leads to lipid accumulation, facilitating atherosclerotic plaque. ATG14 is an essential regulator for the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Whether ATG14 plays a role in macrophage autophagy dysfunction in atherosclerosis is unknown. To investigate the effects of ATG14 on macrophage autophagy, human atherosclerotic plaque, <i>apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and cultured mouse macrophages were evaluated. Overexpression of ATG14 by adenovirus was used to reveal its function in autophagy, inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Results showed that impaired autophagy function with reduction of ATG14 expression existed in macrophages of human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. Ox-LDL impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion with reduction of ATG14 expression in macrophages. Overexpression of ATG14 in macrophages enhanced fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and promoted lipid degradation, decreasing Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response. Augmenting ATG14 expression reversed the autophagy dysfunction in macrophages of <i>apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice plaque, blunted SQSTM1/p62 accumulation, inhibited inflammation, and upregulated the population of Treg cells, resulting in alleviating atherosclerotic lesions.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ABCC1: ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 1; ABCA1: ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 1; Ad-<i>Atg14</i>: adenovirus vector carrying the mouse <i>Atg14</i> gene; Ad-<i>LacZ</i>: adenovirus vector carrying the gene for bacterial 尾-galactosidase; <i>apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i>: apolipoprotein E knockout; ATG14: autophagy-related 14; CD68: CD68 antigen; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Dil-ox-LDL: Dil-oxidized low density lipoprotein; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HFD: high-fat diet (an atherogenic diet); IL: interleukin; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; LDL-C: low density lipoprotrein cholesterol; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; ND: normal diet; Ox-LDL: oxidized low density lipoprotein; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SREBF1/SREBP1c: sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1; SREBF2/SREBP2: sterol regulatory element binding factor 2; STX17: syntaxin 17; TC: serum total cholesterol; TG: triglyceride; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IFN: interferon; Treg cell: regulatory T cell.

37738363	Regulatory circuits of mitophagy restrict distinct modes of cell death during memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell formation.	Mitophagy, a central process guarding mitochondrial quality, is commonly impaired in human diseases such as Parkinson's disease, but its impact in adaptive immunity remains unclear. The differentiation and survival of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rely on oxidative metabolism, a process that requires robust mitochondrial quality control. Here, we found that Parkinson's disease patients have a reduced frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells compared with healthy donors and failed to form memory T cells upon vaccination against COVID-19, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial quality control for memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell formation. We further uncovered that regulators of mitophagy, including Parkin and NIX, were up-regulated in response to interleukin-15 (IL-15) for supporting memory T cell formation. Mechanistically, Parkin suppressed VDAC1-dependent apoptosis in memory T cells. In contrast, NIX expression in T cells counteracted ferroptosis by preventing metabolic dysfunction resulting from impaired mitophagy. Together, our results indicate that the mitophagy machinery orchestrates survival and metabolic dynamics required for memory T cell formation, as well as highlight a deficit in T cell-mediated antiviral responses in Parkinson's disease patients.

38862534	Immunological synapse formation between T regulatory cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes tumour development.	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as a dominant non-hematopoietic cell population in the tumour microenvironment, serving diverse functions in tumour progression. However, the mechanisms via which CAFs influence the anti-tumour immunity remain poorly understood. Here, using multiple tumour models and biopsies from cancer patients, we report that 伪-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAFs can form immunological synapses with Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) in tumours. Notably, 伪-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAFs can phagocytose and process tumour antigens and exhibit a tolerogenic phenotype which instructs movement arrest, activation and proliferation in Tregs in an antigen-specific manner. Moreover, 伪-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAFs display double-membrane structures resembling autophagosomes in their cytoplasm. Single-cell transcriptomic data showed an enrichment in autophagy and antigen processing/presentation pathways in 伪-SMA-expressing CAF clusters. Conditional knockout of Atg5 in 伪-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAFs promoted inflammatory re-programming in CAFs, reduced Treg cell infiltration and attenuated tumour development. Overall, our findings reveal an immunosuppressive mechanism entailing the formation of synapses between 伪-SMA<sup>+</sup> CAFs and Tregs in an autophagy-dependent manner.

39084257	Galectin-3 contributes to pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.	IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of glomerulonephritis that frequently progresses to kidney failure. However, the molecular pathogenesis underlying IgAN remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of galectin-3 (Gal-3), a galactoside-binding protein in IgAN pathogenesis, and showed that Gal-3 expression by the kidney was significantly enhanced in patients with IgAN. In both TEPC-15 hybridoma-derived IgA-induced, passive, and spontaneous "grouped" ddY IgAN models, Gal-3 expression was clearly increased with disease severity in the glomeruli, peri-glomerular regions, and some kidney tubules. Gal-3 knockout (KO) in the passive IgAN model had significantly improved proteinuria, kidney function and reduced severity of kidney pathology, including neutrophil infiltration and decreased differentiation of Th17 cells from kidney-draining lymph nodes, despite increased percentages of regulatory T cells. Gal-3 KO also inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome, yet it enhanced autophagy and improved kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, administration of 6-de-O-sulfated, N-acetylated low-molecular-weight heparin, a competitive Gal-3 binding inhibitor, restored kidney function and improved kidney lesions in passive IgAN mice. Thus, our results suggest that Gal-3 is critically involved in IgAN pathogenesis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and promoting Th17 cell differentiation. Hence, targeting Gal-3 action may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of this kidney disease.

37325630	MAPK8 and CAPN1 as potential biomarkers of intervertebral disc degeneration overlapping immune infiltration, autophagy, and ceRNA.	Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is one of the most common health problems in the elderly and a major causative factor in low back pain (LBP).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify autophagy-related biomarkers and gene regulatory networks in IDD and potential therapeutic targets.

27225864	Involvement of autophagy in T cell biology.	Autophagy is an essential cellular pathway that sequesters various cytoplasmic components, including accumulated proteins, damaged organelles or invading microorganisms and delivers them to lysosomes for degradation. The function of autophagy has been reported in various tissues and systems, including its role in the regulation of cellular immunity. Autophagy plays a fundamental role at various stages of T cell maturation. It regulates the thymocyte selection and the generation of T cell repertoire by presenting intracellular antigens to MHC class molecules. Autophagy is crucial for metabolic regulation of T cells, and therefore supports cell survival and homeostasis, particularly in activated mature T cells. Furthermore, deletion of specific autophagy-related genes induces several immunological alterations including differentiation of activated T cells into regulatory, memory or natural killer T cells. In this review, we emphasize the impact of autophagy on T cell development, activation and differentiation, which is pivotal for the adaptive immune system.

34745852	Tubeimoside-1 induces TFEB-dependent lysosomal degradation of PD-L1 and promotes antitumor immunity by targeting mTOR.	Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) cascade is an effective therapeutic target for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Targeting PD-L1/PD-1 axis by small-molecule drug is an attractive approach to enhance antitumor immunity. Using flow cytometry-based assay, we identify tubeimoside-1 (TBM-1) as a promising antitumor immune modulator that negatively regulates PD-L1 level. TBM-1 disrupts PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and enhances the cytotoxicity of T cells toward cancer cells through decreasing the abundance of PD-L1. Furthermore, TBM-1 exerts its antitumor effect in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma tumor xenograft <i>via</i> activating tumor-infiltrating T-cell immunity. Mechanistically, TBM-1 triggers PD-L1 lysosomal degradation in a TFEB-dependent, autophagy-independent pathway. TBM-1 selectively binds to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and suppresses the activation of mTORC1, leading to the nuclear translocation of TFEB and lysosome biogenesis. Moreover, the combination of TBM-1 and anti-CTLA-4 effectively enhances antitumor T-cell immunity and reduces immunosuppressive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized antitumor mechanism of TBM-1 and represent an alternative ICB therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.		2021	Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

25287445	Autophagy in T-cell development, activation and differentiation.	Autophagy is a vital catabolic process for degrading bulky cytosolic contents, which cannot be resorbed via the proteasome. First described as a survival mechanism during nutrient starvation conditions, recent reports have demonstrated that autophagy supports metabolic functions of T cells at various stages of maturation and effector function. Autophagy is crucial for T-cell development at the precursor stage as self-renewability and quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells depend on autophagy of the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Later, during development in the thymus, autophagy regulates peptide presentation in stromal cells and professional antigen-presenting cells, which mediate thymocyte selection. Furthermore, the metabolic changes when mature T cells enter the periphery and when they are activated are both dependent on autophagy. Lastly, autophagy prevents early aging and, thus, ensures maintenance of memory T cells.

30852245	Autophagy in regulatory T cells: A double-edged sword in disease settings.	Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that directs cytoplasmic proteins, organelles and microbes to lysosomes for degradation. It not only represents an essential cell-intrinsic mechanism to protect against internal and external stresses but also shapes both innate and adaptive immunity. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a developmentally and functionally distinct T cell subpopulation engaged in sustaining immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. There is compelling evidence that autophagy is actively regulated in Tregs and serves as a central signal-dependent controller for Tregs by restraining excessive apoptotic and metabolic activities. In this review, we discuss how autophagy modulates the stability and functionality of Tregs in different disease settings, and provide a perspective on how manipulation of autophagy enables better control of immune response by targeting the generation of Tregs and the maintenance of their stability.

29867990	Cell-Intrinsic Roles for Autophagy in Modulating CD4 T Cell Functions.	The catabolic process of autophagy plays important functions in inflammatory and immune responses by modulating innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Over the last decade, a cell-intrinsic role for autophagy in modulating CD4 T cell functions and differentiation was revealed. After the initial observation of autophagosomes in effector CD4 T cells, further work has shown that not only autophagy levels are modulated in CD4 T cells in response to environmental signals but also that autophagy critically affects the biology of these cells. Mouse models of autophagy deletion in CD4 T cells have indeed shown that autophagy is essential for CD4 T cell survival and homeostasis in peripheral lymphoid organs. Furthermore, autophagy is required for CD4 T cell proliferation and cytokine production in response to T cell receptor activation. Recent developments have uncovered that autophagy controls CD4 T cell differentiation and functions. While autophagy is required for the maintenance of immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells, it restrains the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>9 effector cells, thus limiting their antitumor and pro-inflammatory properties. We will here discuss these findings that collectively suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy could be exploited for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases.

37542852	The impact of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids on macrophage activities in disease: Mechanisms and therapeutic potentials.	Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of carbohydrates by gut microbiota play a crucial role in regulating host physiology. Among them, acetate, propionate, and butyrate are key players in various biological processes. Recent research has revealed their significant functions in immune and inflammatory responses. For instance, butyrate reduces the development of interferon-gamma (IFN-纬) generating cells while promoting the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Propionate inhibits the initiation of a Th2 immune response by dendritic cells (DCs). Notably, SCFAs have an inhibitory impact on the polarization of M2 macrophages, emphasizing their immunomodulatory properties and potential for therapeutics. In animal models of asthma, both butyrate and propionate suppress the M2 polarization pathway, thus reducing allergic airway inflammation. Moreover, dysbiosis of gut microbiota leading to altered SCFA production has been implicated in prostate cancer progression. SCFAs trigger autophagy in cancer cells and promote M2 polarization in macrophages, accelerating tumor advancement. Manipulating microbiota- producing SCFAs holds promise for cancer treatment. Additionally, SCFAs enhance the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) by blocking histone deacetylase, resulting in increased production of antibacterial effectors and improved macrophage-mediated elimination of microorganisms.

38311677	CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophils with dysfunctional autophagy establish systemic immunosuppression by increasing regulatory T cells.	Distinct neutrophil populations arise during certain pathological conditions. The generation of dysfunctional neutrophils during sepsis and their contribution to septicemia-related systemic immune suppression remain unclear. In this study, using an experimental sepsis model that features immunosuppression, we identified a novel population of pathogenic CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophils that are generated during the initial stages of sepsis and contribute to systemic immune suppression by enhancing regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Compared to their CD200R<sup>low</sup> counterparts, sepsis-generated CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophils exhibit impaired autophagy and dysfunction, with reduced chemotactic migration, superoxide anion production, and TNF-伪 production. Increased soluble CD200 blocks autophagy and neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow during experimental sepsis, and recombinant CD200 treatment in vitro can induce neutrophil dysfunction similar to that observed in CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophils. The administration of an 伪-CD200R antibody effectively reversed neutrophil dysfunction by enhancing autophagy and protecting against a secondary infection challenge, leading to increased survival. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophils expressed high levels of Igf1, which elicits the generation of T<sub>reg</sub> cells, while the administration of an 伪-CD200R antibody inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> cell generation in a secondary infection model. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel CD200R<sup>high</sup> neutrophil population that mediates the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced systemic immunosuppression by generating T<sub>reg</sub> cells.

32411145	IL-37 Ameliorating Allergic Inflammation in Atopic Dermatitis Through Regulating Microbiota and AMPK-mTOR Signaling Pathway-Modulated Autophagy Mechanism.	Interaction between eosinophils and dermal fibroblasts is essential for provoking allergic inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD). <i>In vitro</i> co-culture of human eosinophils and dermal fibroblasts upon AD-related IL-31 and IL-33 stimulation, and <i>in vivo</i> MC903-induced AD murine model were employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of IL-1 family cytokine IL-37 in AD. Results showed that IL-37b could inhibit the <i>in vitro</i> induction of AD-related pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-伪, and chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, increase autophagosome biogenesis-related LC3B, and decrease autophagy-associated ubiquitinated protein p62 by regulating intracellular AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. In CRISPR/Cas9 human IL-37b knock-in mice, IL-37b could significantly alleviate MC903-stimulated ear tissue swelling, itching sensation and the level of circulating cytokine IL-6 and ear <i>in situ</i> expression of AD-related TNF-伪, CCL5 and transforming growth factor-尾. Moreover, IL-37b could significantly upregulate Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in spleen and ear together with significantly increased serum Treg cytokine IL-10, and decrease eosinophil infiltration in ear lesion. IL-37b knock-in mice showed a distinct intestinal microbiota metabolic pattern upon MC903 stimulation. Furthermore, IL-37b restored the disordered gut microbiota diversity, through regulating the <i>in vivo</i> autophagy mechanism mediated by intestinal metabolite 3-methyladenine, adenosine monophosphate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, purine and melatonin. In summary, IL-37b could significantly ameliorate eosinophils-mediated allergic inflammation via the regulation of autophagy mechanism, intestinal bacterial diversity and their metabolites in AD. Results therefore suggest that IL-37 is a potential anti-inflammatory cytokine for AD treatment.

30513302	AMBRA1 Controls Regulatory T-Cell Differentiation and Homeostasis Upstream of the FOXO3-FOXP3 Axis.	Regulatory T聽cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) are necessary to maintain immunological tolerance and are key players in the control of autoimmune disease susceptibility. Expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 is essential for differentiation of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and indispensable for their suppressive function. However,聽there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms聽underlying its regulation. Here, we demonstrate that pro-autophagy protein AMBRA1 is also a key modulator of T聽cells, regulating the complex network that leads to human T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation and maintenance. Indeed, through its ability to interact with the phosphatase PP2A, AMBRA1 promotes the stability of the transcriptional activator FOXO3, which, in turn, triggers FOXP3 transcription. Furthermore, we found that AMBRA1 plays a significant role in聽vivo by regulating T<sub>reg</sub> cell induction in mouse models of both tumor growth and multiple sclerosis, thus highlighting the role of AMBRA1 in the control of immune homeostasis.

35895684	Transcription factor EB coordinates environmental cues to regulate T regulatory cells' mitochondrial fitness and function.	T regulatory (Treg) cells are essential for self-tolerance whereas they are detrimental for dampening the host anti-tumor immunity. How Treg cells adapt to environmental signals to orchestrate their homeostasis and functions remains poorly understood. Here, we identified that transcription factor EB (TFEB) is induced by host nutrition deprivation or interleukin (IL)-2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The loss of TFEB in Treg cells leads to reduced Treg accumulation and impaired Treg function in mouse models of cancer and autoimmune disease. TFEB intrinsically regulates genes involved in Treg cell differentiation and mitochondria function while it suppresses expression of proinflammatory cytokines independently of its established roles in autophagy. This coordinated action is required for mitochondria integrity and appropriate lipid metabolism in Treg cells. These findings identify TFEB as a critical regulator for orchestrating Treg generation and function, which may contribute to the adaptive responses of T cells to local environmental cues.

38570836	Gut microbiota-derived butyrate restores impaired regulatory T cells in patients with AChR myasthenia gravis via mTOR-mediated autophagy.	More than 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) are positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress overproduction of these antibodies, and patients with AChR antibody-positive MG (AChR MG) exhibit impaired Treg function and reduced Treg numbers. The gut microbiota and their metabolites play a crucial role in maintaining Treg differentiation and function. However, whether impaired Tregs correlate with gut microbiota activity in patients with AChR MG remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that butyric acid-producing gut bacteria and serum butyric acid level are reduced in patients with AChR MG. Butyrate supplementation effectively enhanced Treg differentiation and their suppressive function of AChR MG. Mechanistically, butyrate activates autophagy of Treg cells by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin. Activation of autophagy increased oxidative phosphorylation and surface expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 on Treg cells, thereby promoting Treg differentiation and their suppressive function in AChR MG. This observed effect of butyrate was blocked using chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, suggesting the vital role of butyrate-activated autophagy in Tregs of patients with AChR MG. We propose that gut bacteria derived butyrate has potential therapeutic efficacy against AChR MG by restoring impaired Tregs.

35039539	Irgm1 regulates metabolism and function in T cell subsets.	Immunity Related GTPases (IRG) are a family of proteins produced during infection that regulate membrane remodeling events in cells, particularly autophagy and mitophagy. The human IRGM gene has been strongly associated with Crohn's disease and other inflammatory diseases through Genome-Wide Association聽studies. Absence of Irgm1 in mice prompts intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity, and impaired immune control of pathogenic bacteria and protozoa. Although prior work has focused on a prominent role for IRGM/Irgm1 in regulating macrophage function, the work described here addresses a potential role of Irgm1 in regulating the function of mature T cells. Irgm1 was found to be highly expressed in T cells in a manner that varied with the particular T cell subset and increased with activation. Mice with a complete lack of Irgm1, or a conditional lack of Irgm1 specifically in T cells, displayed numerous changes in T cell numbers and function in all subsets examined, including CD4<sup>+</sup> (Th1 and Treg) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Related to changes in T cell number, apoptosis was found to be increased in Irgm1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Altered T cell metabolism appeared to be a key driver of the phenotypes: Glucose metabolism and glycolysis were increased in Irgm1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and muting these effects with glycolytic inhibitors partially restored T cell function and viability.

37804507	TRIM11 attenuates Treg cell differentiation by p62-selective autophagic degradation of AIM2.	Ubiquitination is an important protein modification that regulates diverse biological processes, including CD4<sup>+</sup> T聽cell differentiation and functions. However, the function of most E3 ubiquitin ligases in CD4<sup>+</sup> T聽cell differentiation and CD4<sup>+</sup> T聽cell-mediated pathological diseases remains unclear. In this study, we find that tripartite motif-containing motif 11 (TRIM11) specifically negatively regulates regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T聽cells and promotes autoimmune disease development in an AIM2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, TRIM11 interacts with absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and promotes the selective autophagic degradation of AIM2 by inducing AIM2 ubiquitination and binding to p62 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T聽cells. AIM2 attenuates AKT and FOXO1 phosphorylation, MYC signaling, and glycolysis, thereby promoting the stability of Treg cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings suggest that TRIM11 serves as a potential target for immunotherapeutic intervention for dysregulated immune responses that lead to autoimmunity and cancers.

36655333	Autophagy of na茂ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in aging - the role of body adiposity and physical fitness.	Life expectancy has increased exponentially in the last century accompanied by disability, poor quality of life, and all-cause mortality in older age due to the high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity in older people. Biologically, the aging process reduces the cell's metabolic and functional efficiency, and disrupts the cell's anabolic and catabolic homeostasis, predisposing older people to many dysfunctional conditions such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and diabetes. In the immune system, aging also alters cells' metabolic and functional efficiency, a process known as 'immunosenescence', where cells become more broadly inflammatory and their functionality is altered. Notably, autophagy, the conserved and important cellular process that maintains the cell's efficiency and functional homeostasis may protect the immune system from age-associated dysfunctional changes by regulating cell death in activated CD4+ T cells. This regulatory process increases the delivery of the dysfunctional cytoplasmic material to lysosomal degradation while increasing cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation of CD4+ T cell-mediated immune responses. Poor proliferation and diminished responsiveness to cytokines appear to be ubiquitous features of aged T cells and may explain the delayed peak in T cell expansion and cytotoxic activity commonly observed in the 'immunosenescence' phenotype in the elderly. On the other hand, physical exercise stimulates the expression of crucial nutrient sensors and inhibits the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade which increases autophagic activity in cells. Therefore, in this perspective review, we will first contextualize the overall view of the autophagy process and then, we will discuss how body adiposity and physical fitness may counteract autophagy in na茂ve CD4+ T cells in aging.

33355624	ZFP91 is required for the maintenance of regulatory T cell homeostasis and function.	Autophagy programs the metabolic and functional fitness of regulatory T (T reg) cells to establish immune tolerance, yet the mechanisms governing autophagy initiation in T reg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZFP91 facilitates autophagy activation to sustain T reg cell metabolic programming and functional integrity. T reg cell-specific deletion of Zfp91 caused T reg cell dysfunction and exacerbated colonic inflammation and inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis. TCR-triggered autophagy induction largely relied on T reg cell-derived ZFP91 to restrict hyperglycolysis, which is required for the maintenance of T reg cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, ZFP91 rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR stimulation and then mediated BECN1 ubiquitination to promote BECN1-PIK3C3 complex formation. Therefore, our results highlight a ZFP91-dependent mechanism promoting TCR-initiated autophagosome maturation to maintain T reg cell homeostasis and function.

39491776	Mitochondrial mechanisms in Treg cell regulation: Implications for immunotherapy and disease treatment.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. Recent advances in immunometabolism have revealed the pivotal role of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism in shaping Treg functionality. Tregs depend on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to support their suppressive functions and long-term survival. Mitochondrial processes such as fusion and fission significantly influence Treg activity, with mitochondrial fusion enhancing bioenergetic efficiency and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby promoting Treg stability. In contrast, excessive mitochondrial fission disrupts ATP synthesis and elevates ROS levels, impairing Treg suppressive capacity. Furthermore, mitochondrial ROS act as critical signaling molecules in Treg regulation, where controlled levels stabilize FoxP3 expression, but excessive ROS leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation. Mitophagy, as part of mitochondrial quality control, also plays an essential role in preserving Treg function. Understanding the intricate interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and Treg metabolism provides valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat autoimmune disorders and enhance immunotherapy in cancer.

27943115	Harnessing bone marrow resident regulatory T cells to improve allogeneic stem cell transplant outcomes.	Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a suppressive T cell population which play a crucial role in the establishment of tolerance after stem cell transplantation (SCT) by controlling the effector T cell responses that drive acute and chronic GVHD. The BM compartment is enriched in a highly suppressive, activated/memory autophagy-dependent Treg population, which contributes to the HSC engraftment and the control of GVHD. G-CSF administration releases Treg from the BM through disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis and further improves Treg survival following SCT through the induction of autophagy. However, AMD3100 is more efficacious in mobilizing these Treg highlighting the potential for optimized mobilization regimes to produce more tolerogenic grafts. Notably, the disruption of adhesive interaction between integrins and their ligands contributes to HSC mobilization and may be relevant for BM Treg. Importantly, the Tregs in the BM niche contribute to maintenance of the HSC niche and appear required for optimal control of GVHD post-transplant. Although poorly studied, the BM Treg appear phenotypically and functionally unique to Treg in the periphery. Understanding the requirements for maintaining the enrichment, function and survival of BM Treg needs to be further investigated to improve therapeutic strategies and promote tolerance after SCT.

37084875	Disruption in networking of KCMF1 linked ubiquitin ligase impairs autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells of patients with renal cell carcinoma.	Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) remains incurable, despite the current checkpoint-blockade-driven, limited overall response rate. The CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells can mount a rapid and an effective response. The ubiquitin ligase RAD6-KCMF1-UBR4-mediated regulation of autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unexplored. Consequently, flow cytometry was used to study memory T cells, and their subsets, including activation and regulatory phenotypes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of the ubiquitin ligase and autophagy was measured both at the cellular and molecular levels in memory T cells of patients with RCC. JC.1 staining and Annexin/PI assays were used to evaluate the memory T cells depolarization and apoptosis rates. The results indicated that the disruption of Ub-E2-E3 complex and impaired autophagy in memory T cells diminished their ability to survive and combat against tumor cells. Inhibition of memory T cells apoptosis by targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase or autophagy pathways can be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the long-term survival of memory T cells in RCC.

35404405	Carbon Monoxide Activates PERK-Regulated Autophagy to Induce Immunometabolic Reprogramming and Boost Antitumor T-cell Function.	Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) share structural and functional networks and activate well-orchestrated signaling processes to shape cells' fate and function. While persistent ER stress (ERS) response leads to mitochondrial collapse, moderate ERS promotes mitochondrial function. Strategies to boost antitumor T-cell function by targeting ER-mitochondria cross-talk have not yet been exploited. Here, we used carbon monoxide (CO), a short-lived gaseous molecule, to test whether engaging moderate ERS conditions can improve mitochondrial and antitumor functions in T cells. In melanoma antigen-specific T cells, CO-induced transient activation of ERS sensor protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) significantly increased antitumor T-cell function. Furthermore, CO-induced PERK activation temporarily halted protein translation and induced protective autophagy, including mitophagy. The use of LC3-GFP enabled differentiation between the cells that prepare themselves to undergo active autophagy (LC3-GFPpos) and those that fail to enter the process (LC3-GFPneg). LC3-GFPpos T cells showed strong antitumor potential, whereas LC3-GFPneg cells exhibited a T regulatory-like phenotype, harbored dysfunctional mitochondria, and accumulated abnormal metabolite content. These anomalous ratios of metabolites rendered the cells with a hypermethylated state and distinct epigenetic profile, limiting their antitumor activity. Overall, this study shows that ERS-activated autophagy pathways modify the mitochondrial function and epigenetically reprogram T cells toward a superior antitumor phenotype to achieve robust tumor control.

37213143	Correlation of miR-125b with Treg/Th17 Cell Imbalance in Condyloma Acuminatum and Its Regulation on Autophagy of Keratinocytes.	Condyloma acuminatum (CA), a sexually transmitted disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the present research aims to analyze the mechanism of microRNA-125b (miR-125b) in condyloma acuminatum (CA) and its correlation with Treg/Th17 cell imbalance, the objective is to provide new research ideas for the prevention and treatment of CA in the future. The study population comprised 57 CA patients admitted between April 2020 and June 2022 (observation group, OG) and 64 concurrent healthy controls (control group, CG). The peripheral blood miR-125b and Treg/Th17 cells in all participants were detected to identify the correlation of miR-125b with CA severity and Treg/Th17 cells, and the diagnostic value of miR-125b for CA was analyzed. Then keratinocytes (KCs) from skin lesions of CA patients were isolated. Besides, autophagic proteins LC3-II and Beclin-1 in KCs were measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. miR-125b expression and Th17 cell percentage were lower in OG than in CG, and reduced gradually with the increase of CA severity, while the Treg cell percentage was higher versus CG and increased as CA worsened (P<0.05). miR-125b exhibited a positive association with Th17 cell percentage and an inverse correlation with Treg cell percentage (P<0.05). ROC analysis identified the excellent diagnostic effect of miR-125b on CA (P<0.05). In vitro, increasing miR-125b decreased the ability of KCs to proliferate, enhanced the apoptosis rate, and elevated LC3-II and Beclin-1 expression (P<0.05). In Conclusion, miR-125b, under-expressed in CA, is closely related to Th17/Treg cell imbalance, the mechanism is related to inhibiting the autophagy of KCs and promoting their abnormal proliferation.

26808230	Autophagy enforces functional integrity of regulatory T cells by coupling environmental cues and metabolic homeostasis.	Regulatory T (Treg) cells respond to immune and inflammatory signals to mediate immunosuppression, but how the functional integrity of Treg cells is maintained under activating environments is unclear. Here we show that autophagy is active in Treg cells and supports their lineage stability and survival fitness. Treg cell-specific deletion of Atg7 or Atg5, two essential genes in autophagy, leads to loss of Treg cells, greater tumor resistance and development of inflammatory disorders. Atg7-deficient Treg cells show increased apoptosis and readily lose expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, especially after activation. Mechanistically, autophagy deficiency upregulates metabolic regulators mTORC1 and c-Myc and glycolysis, which contribute to defective Treg function. Therefore, autophagy couples environmental signals and metabolic homeostasis to protect lineage and survival integrity of Treg cells in activating contexts.

38346408	Defective autophagy and autophagy activators in myasthenia gravis: a rare entity and unusual scenario.	Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that results from autoantibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) at NMJs. These autoantibodies are mainly originated from autoreactive B cells that bind and destroy nAchRs at NMJs preventing nerve impulses from activating the end-plates of skeletal muscle. Indeed, immune dysregulation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MG. Autoreactive B cells are increased in MG due to the defect in the central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. As well, autoreactive T cells are augmented in MG due to the diversion of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells or a defect in thymic anergy leading to T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Furthermore, macroautophagy/autophagy, which is a conserved cellular catabolic process, plays a critical role in autoimmune diseases by regulating antigen presentation, survival of immune cells and cytokine-mediated inflammation. Abnormal autophagic flux is associated with different autoimmune disorders. Autophagy regulates the connection between innate and adaptive immune responses by controlling the production of cytokines and survival of T<sub>regs</sub>. As autophagy is involved in autoimmune disorders, it may play a major role in the pathogenesis of MG. Therefore, this mini-review demonstrates the potential role of autophagy and autophagy activators in MG.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Ach, acetylcholine; B<sub>reg</sub>, regulatory B; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MG, myasthenia gravis; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; ROS, reactive oxygen species; T<sub>reg</sub>, regulatory T; Ubl, ubiquitin-like.

17012832	Autophagy and CD4+ T lymphocyte destruction by HIV-1.	The first step of HIV-1 infection is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (Env) to CD4 and two major coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. The HIV-1 strains that use CCR5 are involved in primo-infection whereas those HIV-1 strains that use CXCR4 play a major role in the demise of CD4+ T lymphocytes and a rapid progression toward AIDS. Notably, binding of X4 Env expressed on cells to CXCR4 triggers apoptosis of uninfected CD4+ T cells. We now have just demonstrated that, independently of HIV-1 replication, transfected or HIV-1-infected cells that express X4 Env induce autophagy and accumulation of Beclin 1 in uninfected CD4+ T lymphocytes via CXCR4. Moreover, autophagy is a prerequisite to Env-induced apoptosis in uninfected bystander T cells, and CD4+ T cells still undergo an Env-mediated cell death with autophagic features when apoptosis is inhibited. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first example of autophagy triggered through binding of virus envelope proteins to a cellular receptor, without viral replication, leading to apoptosis. Here, we proposed hypotheses about the significance of Env-induced Beclin 1 accumulation in CD4+ T cell death and about the role of autophagy in HIV-1 infected cells depending on the coreceptor involved.

32122794	Sarcoidosis and the mTOR, Rac1, and Autophagy Triad.	Sarcoidosis is an enigmatic multisystem disease characterized by the development and accumulation of granulomas: a compact collection of macrophages that have differentiated into epithelioid cells and which are associated with T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells. Although no single causative factor has been shown to underlie sarcoidosis in humans, its etiology has been related to microbial, environmental, and genetic factors. We examine how these factors play a role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Specifically, we propose that dysfunction of mTOR, Rac1, and autophagy-related pathways not only hampers pathogen or nonorganic particle clearance but also participates in T cell and macrophage dysfunction, driving granuloma formation. This concept opens new avenues for potentially treating sarcoidosis and may serve as a blueprint for other granulomatous disorders.

35439818	Enhancing and stabilization of cord blood regulatory T-cell suppressive function by human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes.	FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are central to maintaining peripheral tolerance and immune homeostasis. They have the potential to be developed as a cellular therapy to treat various clinical ailments such as autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases and to improve transplantation outcomes. However, a major question remains whether Tregs can persist and exert their function effectively in a disease state, where a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators could inactivate Tregs. In this study, we investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes to promote and sustain Tregs function. MSC-conditioned media (MSC-CM) cultured Tregs were more suppressive in both polyclonal and allogeneic responses and were resistant to inflammatory stimulation in vitro compared with the controls. A similar enhancement of Treg function was also observed by culturing Tregs with MSC-derived exosomes alone. The enhanced suppressive activity and stability of Treg cultured in MSC-CM was reduced when exosomes were depleted from MSC-CM. We identified that MSC-derived exosomes could upregulate the expression of LC3(II/I), phosphorylate Jak3 and Stat5 to promote Treg survival, and regulate FOXP3 expression in Tregs. Overall, our study demonstrates that MSC-derived exosomes are capable of enhancing Hucb-Tregs function and stability by activating autophagy and Stat5 signalling pathways. Our findings provide a strong rationale for utilizing MSC-derived exosomes as an effective strategy to enhance Treg function, and improve the overall Tregs-based cell therapy landscape.

Quantitative and/or qualitative defects in Tregs result in diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy, malignancy, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We recently reported increased expression of autophagy-related genes (<i>Atg</i>) in association with enhanced survival of Tregs after SCT. Autophagy is a self-degradative process for cytosolic components that promotes cell homeostasis and survival. Here, we demonstrate that the disruption of autophagy within FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (B6.<i>Atg7<sup>fl/fl</sup>-FoxP3cre<sup>+</sup></i> ) resulted in a profound loss of Tregs, particularly within the bone marrow (BM). This resulted in dysregulated effector T cell activation and expansion, and the development of enterocolitis and scleroderma in aged mice. We show that the BM compartment is highly enriched in TIGIT<sup>+</sup> Tregs and that this subset is differentially depleted in the absence of autophagy. Moreover, following allogeneic SCT, recipients of grafts from B6.<i>Atg7<sup>fl/fl</sup>-FoxP3cre<sup>+</sup></i> donors exhibited reduced Treg reconstitution, exacerbated GVHD, and reduced survival compared with recipients of B6.<i>WT-FoxP3cre<sup>+</sup></i> grafts. Collectively, these data indicate that autophagy-dependent Tregs are critical for the maintenance of tolerance after SCT and that the promotion of autophagy represents an attractive immune-restorative therapeutic strategy after allogeneic SCT.

31815154	Autophagy in Immune-Related Renal Disease.	Autophagy is an important biology process, central to the maintenance of biology process in both physiological and pathological situations. It is regarded as a "double-edged sword"-exerting both protective and/or detrimental effects. These two-way effects are observed in immune cells as well as renal resident cells, including podocytes, mesangial cells, tubular epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries. Mounting evidence suggests that autophagy is implicated in the pathological process of various immune-related renal diseases (IRRDs) as well as the kidney that underwent transplantation. Here, we provide an overview of the pathological role of autophagy in IRRDs, including lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, membrane nephropathy, ANCA-associated nephritis, and diabetic nephropathy. The understanding of the pathogenesis and regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in these renal diseases may lead to the identification of new diagnostic targets and refined therapeutic modulation.

32319705	The TGF-b/SOX4 axis and ROS-driven autophagy co-mediate CD39 expression in regulatory T-cells.	The ectonucleotidase CD39 on human regulatory T-cells (Treg) is an important immune regulator which is dysregulated in autoimmune diseases and cancer immunosuppression. We here define that CD39 expression on Treg is independent of the Treg-specific transcription factors FOXP3 and HELIOS and promoted by canonical TGF-b- and mTOR-signaling. Furthermore, the TGF-b mediated upregulation of CD39 is counteracted by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven autophagy. In line, CD39<sup>+</sup> peripheral blood Treg constitute a distinct lineage with low autophagic flux and absent ROS production. Patients with rare genetic defects in autophagy show supraphysiological levels of CD39<sup>+</sup> Treg, validating our observations in vivo. These biological processes rely on a distinct transcriptional program with CD39<sup>+</sup> Treg expressing low levels of two genes with putative involvement in autophagy, NEFL and PLAC8. Furthermore, the TGF-b downstream transcription factor SOX4 is selectively upregulated in CD39<sup>+</sup> Treg. Overexpression of SOX4 in Treg strongly increases CD39 expression, while Crispr/Cas9-mediated knockout of SOX4 in Treg has the opposing effect. Thus, we identify a crucial role of SOX4 in immune regulation and provide new insights involving the interplay of tolerogenic cues and autophagy in Treg.

40131367	Long noncoding RNA BCYRN1 promotes cardioprotection by enhancing human and murine regulatory T cell dynamics.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) modulate immune responses and attenuate inflammation. Extracellular vesicles from human cardiosphere-derived cells (CDC-EVs) enhance Treg proliferation and IL-10 production, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we focused on BCYRN1, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) highly abundant in CDC-EVs, and its role in Treg function. BCYRN1 acts as a "microRNA sponge," inhibiting miR-138, miR-150, and miR-98. Suppression of these miRs leads to increased Treg proliferation via ATG7-dependent autophagy, CCR6-dependent Treg migration, and enhanced Treg IL-10 production. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, CDC-EVs, particularly those overexpressing BCYRN1, were cardioprotective, reducing infarct size and troponin I levels even when administered after reperfusion. Underlying the cardioprotection, we verified that CDC-EVs overexpressing BCYRN1 increased cardiac Treg infiltration, proliferation, and IL-10 production in vivo. These salutary effects were negated when BCYRN1 levels were reduced in CDC-EVs or when Tregs were depleted systemically. Thus, we have identified BCYRN1 as a booster of Treg number and bioactivity, rationalizing its cardioprotective efficacy. While we studied BCYRN1 overexpression in the context of ischemic injury here, the same approach merits testing in other disease processes (e.g., autoimmunity or transplant rejection) where increased Treg activity is a recognized therapeutic goal.

24962260	Integrating canonical and metabolic signalling programmes in the regulation of T cell responses.	Over the past decade, our understanding of T cell activation, differentiation and function has markedly expanded, providing a greater appreciation of the signals and pathways that regulate these processes. It has become clear that evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate stress responses, metabolism, autophagy and survival have crucial and specific roles in regulating T cell responses. Recent studies suggest that the metabolic pathways involving MYC, hypoxia-inducible factor 1伪 (HIF1伪), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are activated upon antigen recognition and that they are required for directing the consequences of T cell receptor engagement. The purpose of this Review is to provide an integrated view of the role of these metabolic pathways and of canonical T cell signalling pathways in regulating the outcome of T cell responses.

35652357	Investigating immunoregulatory effects of myeloid cell autophagy in acute and chronic inflammation.	Studies have highlighted a critical role for autophagy in the regulation of multiple cytokines. Autophagy inhibits the release of interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokines, including IL-1伪, IL-1尾 and IL-18, by myeloid cells. This, in turn, impacts the release of other cytokines by myeloid cells, as well as other cells of the immune system, including IL-22, IL-23, IL-17 and interferon-纬. Here, we assessed the impact of genetic depletion of the autophagy gene Atg7 in myeloid cells on acute and chronic inflammation. In a model of acute lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, loss of autophagy in myeloid cells resulted in increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, both locally and systemically. By contrast, loss of Atg7 in myeloid cells in the Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> model of lupus-like autoimmunity resulted in reduced systemic release of IL-6 and IL-10, with no effects on other cytokines observed. In addition, Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> mice with autophagy-deficient myeloid cells showed reduced expression of autoantibodies relevant to systemic lupus erythematosus, including anti-histone and anti-Smith protein. In vitro, loss of autophagy, through pharmacological inhibition or small interfering RNA against Becn1, inhibited IL-10 release by human and mouse myeloid cells. This effect was evident at the level of Il10 messenger RNA expression. Our data highlight potentially important differences in the role of myeloid cell autophagy in acute and chronic inflammation and demonstrate a direct role for autophagy in the production and release of IL-10 by macrophages.

27267497	Notch1 regulated autophagy controls survival and suppressor activity of activated murine T-regulatory cells.	Cell survival is one of several processes regulated by the Notch pathway in mammalian cells. Here we report functional outcomes of non-nuclear Notch signaling to activate autophagy, a conserved cellular response to nutrient stress, regulating survival in murine natural T-regulatory cells (Tregs), an immune subset controlling tolerance and inflammation. Induction of autophagy required ligand-dependent, Notch intracellular domain (NIC) activity, which controlled mitochondrial organization and survival of activated Tregs. Consistently, NIC immune-precipitated Beclin and Atg14, constituents of the autophagy initiation complex. Further, ectopic expression of an effector of autophagy (Atg3) or recombinant NIC tagged to a nuclear export signal (NIC-NES), restored autophagy and suppressor function in Notch1(-/-) Tregs. Furthermore, Notch1 deficiency in the Treg lineage resulted in immune hyperactivity, implicating Notch activity in Treg homeostasis. Notch1 integration with autophagy, revealed in these experiments, holds implications for Notch regulated cell-fate decisions governing differentiation.

29459719	miR-142-3p regulates autophagy by targeting ATG16L1 in thymic-derived regulatory T cell (tTreg).	Thymic-derived regulatory T cell (tTreg) clinical trials show therapeutic promise in the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. However, strategies are needed to improve tTreg proliferative ability and survival as a means to improve tTreg therapy and reduce the requirement for producing large numbers of Treg cells for adoptive tTreg transfer. Autophagy is a self-degradative process for cytosolic components, which is involved in cells death, differentiation, lymphocyte homeostasis, and tTreg function. Studies have shown that mice with tTreg cells that have a disrupted autophagy process have defective tTreg cell generation and function, resulting in autoimmune disease and failed GVHD prevention by adoptively transferred tTreg cells. We found the attenuated autophagy status during ex vivo expansion, which leads us to determine whether tTreg cell survival could be augmented by miR-142-3p, the miRNA which is highly expressed in tTreg cells and potentially targets autophagy-related protein (ATG)-1, ATG16L1. We demonstrate that miR-142-3p downregulates ATG16L1 mRNA and production of ATG16L1, that has been linked to autoimmune diseases. Conversely, miR-142-3p knock-down improved tTreg cell expansion, survival and function in vitro and vivo. In aggregate, these studies provide a new approach that uses miR-142-3p knockdown to increase tTreg cell efficacy by increasing ATG16L1 mRNA and protein and the autophagy process.

29610255	PDL-1 Blockade Prevents T Cell Exhaustion, Inhibits Autophagy, and Promotes Clearance of Leishmania donovani.	<i>Leishmania donovani</i> is a causative pathogen of potentially fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Therapeutic agents are available; however, their use is limited because of high cost, serious side effects, and development of antimicrobial resistance. Protective immunity against VL depends on CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell-mediated immunity. Studies have shown that progression of VL is due to exhaustion of T cells; however, the mechanism involved is not clearly understood. Here, we examined the role of PD1/PDL-1 in the pathogenesis of VL by using a murine model of VL. Our data indicate that <i>L. donovani</i> is able to elicit initial expansion of gamma interferon-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at day 7 postinfection (p.i.); however, the frequency of those cells and inflammatory response decreased at day 21 p.i., despite persistence of parasites. Persistent infection-induced expansion of interleukin-10<sup>+</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing PD1. Blocking of PDL-1 signaling <i>in vivo</i> resulted in restoration of protective type 1 responses by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which resulted in a significant decrease in the parasite burden. Mechanistically, PDL-1 blocking inhibited autophagy, a cellular degradation process hijacked by <i>Leishmania</i> to acquire host cell nutrients for their survival. Inhibition of autophagy was marked by decreased lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, a marker of autophagosome formation, and P62 accumulation. Together, our findings show for the first time that anti-PDL-1 antibody is an effective therapeutic approach for restoration of effector arms of protective immunity against VL and subsequent parasite clearance.

33488601	CD39<sup>+</sup> Regulatory T Cells Attenuate Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury <i>via</i> Autophagy and the ERK/FOS Pathway.	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by an uncontrollable cytokine storm, which is associated with high mortality due to lack of effective treatment. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an indispensable role in maintaining immune homeostasis and CD39 is considered as a functional cell marker of Tregs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs on acute lung injury (ALI) and investigate the frequency of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs in ARDS patients. We found that after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, CD39<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited more severe inflammation and wild type (WT) mice exhibited a decreased frequency of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs had a protective effect on LPS-induced inflammation <i>in vitro</i> and the adoptive transfer of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs had a therapeutic effect on ALI <i>in vivo</i>. We further sought to explore the mechanisms that affect CD39 expression on Tregs. LPS-induced inflammation in the lung impaired the immunosuppressive effect of Tregs <i>via</i> the autophagy-mediated downregulation of CD39. In addition, CD39 induced the expression of itself in Tregs <i>via</i> activating the ERK1/2-FOS pathway. Consistent with this finding, the frequency of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs was also decreased in the peripheral blood of ARDS patients and was positively correlated with disease severity. Our results suggested that the adoptive transfer of CD39<sup>+</sup> Tregs may provide a novel method for the clinical prevention and treatment of ARDS.

39738384	An AMBRA1, ULK1 and PP2A regulatory network regulates cytotoxic T cell differentiation via TFEB activation.	The scaffold protein AMBRA1, which participates in the autophagy pathway, also promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to Tregs independent of autophagy through its interactor PP2A. Here we have investigated the role of AMBRA1 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to cytotoxic T cells (CTL). AMBRA1 depletion in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was associated with impaired expression of the transcription factors RUNX3 and T-BET that drive CTL differentiation and resulted in impaired acquisition of cytotoxic potential. These effects were recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition of the AMBRA1 activator ULK1 or its interactor PP2A. Based on the ability of PP2A to activate TFEB, we hypothesized a role for TFEB in the CTL differentiation program regulated by AMBRA1. We show that TFEB modulates RUNX3 and T-BET expression and the generation of killing-competent CTLs, and that AMBRA1 depletion, or ULK1 or PP2A inhibition, suppresses TFEB activity. These data highlight a role for AMBRA1, ULK1 and PP2A in CTL generation, mediated by TFEB, which we identify as a new pioneering transcription factor in the CTL differentiation program.

37850953	RGS1 Modulates Autophagic and Metabolic Programs and Is a Critical Mediator of Human Regulatory T Cell Function.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical mediators of immune tolerance and play a diametric role in cancer and autoimmunity. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs are often associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors because their enrichment in the tumor microenvironment contributes to immunosuppression. Conversely, dysregulation in the Treg compartment can disrupt self-tolerance, leading to autoimmunity. In the present study, we describe what is, to our knowledge, a novel regulator of Tregs, the GTPase activator regulator of G protein 1 (RGS1), demonstrating that RGS1-deficient human Tregs show downregulation of Treg-associated genes and are less immunosuppressive. These RGS1-deficient Tregs exhibit perturbations to the FOXP3-c-MYC transcriptional axis and downstream metabolic and autophagy programs by shifting their energy demands toward glycolysis and rendering them less autophagic. Taken together, RGS1 may serve as an apical node of Treg function by regulating the FOXP3-c-MYC transcriptional axis, thereby providing a therapeutic rationale for targeting RGS1 for treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

28572806	Impaired Autophagy and Defective T Cell Homeostasis in Mice with T Cell-Specific Deletion of Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1.	Autophagy plays a central role in maintaining T cell homeostasis. Our previous study has shown that hepatocyte-specific deficiency of receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) leads to lipid accumulation in the liver, accompanied by impaired autophagy, but its <i>in vivo</i> role in T cells remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with T cell-specific deletion of RACK1 exhibit normal intrathymic development of conventional T cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells but reduced numbers of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Such defects are cell intrinsic with impaired mitochondrial clearance, increased sensitivity to cell death, and decreased proliferation that could be explained by impaired autophagy. Furthermore, RACK1 is essential for invariant natural T cell development. <i>In vivo</i>, T cell-specific loss of RACK1 dampens concanavalin A-induced acute liver injury. Our data suggest that RACK1 is a key regulator of T cell homeostasis.		2017	Frontiers in immunology
36279072	T cell dysregulation in inflammatory diseases in ICU.	Severe inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, are characterized by an impaired host adaptive and innate immunity which results in immunosuppression, responsible for secondary infections and increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. T cells are major actors of the immune system. During post-aggressive immunosuppression, lymphopenia, reduction of innate T cells, changes in T helper cell polarization and regulatory T cell increase are observed. The main mechanisms involved in T cell dysregulation are T cell apoptosis, autophagy deficiency, T cell anergy, T cell exhaustion and T cell metabolic reprogramming. In this review, we describe the alterations of T cell regulation, their mechanisms, and their association with clinical outcomes in severe inflammatory diseases, foremost of which is the sepsis.		2022	Intensive care medicine experimental

32318017	Effects of Mitophagy on Regulatory T Cell Function in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis.	<b>Objective:</b> This study was conducted to determine whether regulatory T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>T, Tregs) show abnormal mitophagy as well as the function of Tregs in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). <b>Methods:</b> CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Treg cells were obtained from 15 patients with MG (MG group) and 15 controls (N group). Tregs from the MG group were subjected to rapamycin-induced culture for 48 h (Rapa group) and 3-methyladenine-induced culture for 48 h (3-MA group). The levels of mitophagy in Tregs were then observed through electron and confocal microscopy. Expression of the autophagy-related protein LC3-II was detected by western blotting, and mitochondrial function in each group was evaluated by flow cytometry. Inhibition of Treg cell proliferation was detected by flow cytometry. <b>Results:</b> Mitophagy in the MG group was lower than that in the N group; it was higher in the Rapa group compared to that in the MG group and lowered in the 3-MA group than in the MG group. Expression of the autophagy-related protein LC3-II was lower in the MG group than in the N group, higher in the Rapa group than in the MG group, and lower in the 3-MA group than in the MG group. The mitochondrial membrane potential was lower in the MG group compared to that in the N group; it was higher in the Rapa group than in the MG group and lowered in the 3-MA group than in the MG group. Inhibition of Treg proliferation was lower in the MG group than in the N group; it was higher in the Rapa group than in the MG group and lowered in the 3-MA group than in the MG group. <b>Conclusion:</b> The decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitophagy in Tregs in the MG group may be related to a decreased inhibition of Treg proliferation. The mitochondrial membrane potential was increased after adding the autophagy agent Rapa to enhance mitophagy, and the proliferation inhibition function of Tregs was also enhanced. The autophagy agent 3-MA down-regulated mitophagy, which decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibitory effect of Tregs. These results reveal the possible cellular immune mechanism of Treg dysfunction in MG.		2020	Frontiers in neurology
35286691	The Immunogenetics of Alopecia areata.	Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that targets the hair follicles (HF) and results in non-scarring hair loss. AA results from the collapse of the HF's immune privilege due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors that either change the local HF dynamics or dysregulate the central immune tolerance. Multiple genetic studies have attempted to identify AA susceptibility genes through candidate gene approaches and genome-wide analysis. These studies were able to show an association between AA and multiple immune-related genes such as those encoding cytokines, chemokines, molecules involved in regulatory T-cell functions, and adaptor molecules along with genes involved in autophagy, melanogenesis, and hair cycling pathways. This chapter aims to explore these genes and their contribution to the pathogenesis of the AA.

35691121	PD-1 inhibitor induces myocarditis by reducing regulatory T cells, activating inflammatory responses, promoting myocardial apoptosis and autophagy.	The present study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of autoimmune myocarditis induced by PD-1 inhibitors and their potential therapeutic targets. Mouse models of autoimmune myocarditis induced by PD-1 inhibitor in mouse models of polymyositis were established. The expression level of PD-1 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD4, CD8聽+聽T cells, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy-related factors, including IL-6, TGF-尾, AMA-M2, Fas/FasL, LC3 and p62 were detected in peripheral blood, muscle or myocardium of mice in each group, using ELISA, RT-PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence. In addition, HE and TUNEL staining and ultrastructural scanning were performed on the myocardium of mice in each group. Results showed that the expression level of PD-1 in the two myositis groups was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the level of PD-1 was lower in the myocarditis group than that in the polymyositis group. In the myocardium, TGF-尾, p62, and Tregs proportion showed the same expression level trend as PD-1, while CD8, IL-6, IL-10 and LC3 showed the opposite trend. Levels of Fas/FasL were significantly higher in both myositis groups, but were slightly lower in the myocarditis group, as was AMA-M2. Inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy were observed in both myositis groups, but were more severe in the myocarditis group. In summary, the decreased expression level of PD-1 leads to decreased Tregs level in the myocardium, aggravated inflammatory response, apoptosis and autophagy, which may be the pathological mechanism of myocarditis induced by PD-1 inhibitors.

36678282	Nutraceuticals as Potential Therapeutic Modulators in Immunometabolism.	Nutraceuticals act as cellular and functional modulators, contributing to the homeostasis of physiological processes. In an inflammatory microenvironment, these functional foods can interact with the immune system by modulating or balancing the exacerbated proinflammatory response. In this process, immune cells, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), identify danger signals and, after interacting with T lymphocytes, induce a specific effector response. Moreover, this conditions their change of state with phenotypical and functional modifications from the resting state to the activated and effector state, supposing an increase in their energy requirements that affect their intracellular metabolism, with each immune cell showing a unique metabolic signature. Thus, nutraceuticals, such as polyphenols, vitamins, fatty acids, and sulforaphane, represent an active option to use therapeutically for health or the prevention of different pathologies, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. To regulate the inflammation associated with these pathologies, intervention in metabolic pathways through the modulation of metabolic energy with nutraceuticals is an attractive strategy that allows inducing important changes in cellular properties. Thus, we provide an overview of the link between metabolism, immune function, and nutraceuticals in chronic inflammatory processes associated with obesity and diabetes, paying particular attention to nutritional effects on APC and T cell immunometabolism, as well as the mechanisms required in the change in energetic pathways involved after their activation.

33581928	Molecular and immunological developments in placentas.	Cytotrophoblasts differentiate in two directions during early placentation: syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). STBs face maternal immune cells in placentas, and EVTs, which invade the decidua and uterine myometrium, face the cells in the uterus. This situation, in which trophoblasts come into contact with maternal immune cells, is known as the maternal-fetal interface. Despite fetuses and fetus-derived trophoblast cells being of the semi-allogeneic conceptus, fetuses and placentas are not rejected by the maternal immune system because of maternal-fetal tolerance. The acquired tolerance develops during normal placentation, resulting in normal fetal development in humans. In this review, we introduce placental development from the viewpoint of molecular biology. In addition, we discuss how the disruption of placental development could lead to complications in pregnancy, such as hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, or miscarriage.

38467995	Immunological regulation and the role of autophagy in preeclampsia.	Autophagy is a bulk degradation system that maintains cellular homeostasis by producing energy and/or recycling excess proteins. During early placentation, extravillous trophoblasts invade the decidua and uterine myometrium, facing maternal immune cells, which participate in the immune suppression of paternal and fetal antigens. Regulatory T cells will likely increase in response to a specific antigen before and during early pregnancy. Insufficient expansion of antigen-specific Treg cells, which possess the same T cell receptor, is associated with the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, suggesting sterile systemic inflammation. Autophagy is involved in reducing inflammation through the degradation of inflammasomes and in the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells. Autophagy dysregulation induces protein aggregation in trophoblasts, resulting in placental dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the role of regulatory T cells in normal pregnancies. In addition, we discuss the association between autophagy and regulatory T cells in the development of preeclampsia based on reports on the role of autophagy in autoimmune diseases.

Therapeutic strategies that provide effective and broad-spectrum neutralization against HIV-1 infection are highly desirable. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated the potential of nanoengineered CD4+ T cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (TNP) encapsulating the DIABLO/SMAC mimetics LCL-161 or AT-406 (also known as SM-406 or Debio 1143) to both neutralize HIV-1 and selectively kill HIV-1-infected resting CD4+ T cells and macrophages. <b>Results:</b> DIABLO/SMAC mimetic-loaded TNP displayed outstanding neutralizing breadth and potency, and selectively kill HIV-1-infected cells via autophagy-dependent apoptosis while having no drug-induced off-target or cytotoxic effects on bystander cells. Genetic inhibition of early stages of autophagy abolishes this effect. <b>Conclusion:</b> DIABLO/SMAC mimetic loaded TNP have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents to neutralize cell-free HIV-1 and to kill specifically HIV-1-infected cells as part of an HIV-1 cure strategy.

36479119	Ferroptosis increases obesity: Crosstalk between adipocytes and the neuroimmune system.	Ferroptosis requires not only the accumulation of iron ions, but also changes in many ferroptosis-related regulators, including a decrease in GPX4 and inhibition of SLC7A11 for classical ferroptosis, a deletion of FSP1 or GCH1. Surprisingly, adipose tissue (AT) in the obesity conditions is also accompanied by iron buildup, decreased GSH, and increased ROS. On the neurological side, the pro-inflammatory factor released by AT may have first caused ferroptosis in the vagus nerve by inhibiting of the NRF2-GPX4 pathway, resulting in disorders of the autonomic nervous system. On the immune side, obesity may cause M2 macrophages ferroptosis due to damage to iron-rich ATMs (MFe<sup>hi</sup>) and antioxidant ATMs (Mox), and lead to Treg cells ferroptosis through reductions in NRF2, GPX4, and GCH1 levels. At the same time, the reduction in GPX4 may also trigger the ferroptosis of B1 cells. In addition, some studies have also found the role of GPX4 in neutrophil autophagy, which is also worth pondering whether there is a connection with ferroptosis. In conclusion, this review summarizes the associations between neuroimmune regulation associated with obesity and ferroptosis, and on the basis of this, highlights their potential molecular mechanisms, proposing that ferroptosis in one or more cells in a multicellular tissue changes the fate of that tissue.

27860274	Mechanistic roles of autophagy in hematopoietic differentiation.	Autophagy is increasingly recognized for its active role in development and differentiation. In particular, its role in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells has been extensively studied, likely because blood cells are accessible, easy to identify and purify, and their progenitor tree is well defined. This review aims to discuss the mechanisms by which autophagy impacts on differentiation, using hematopoietic cell types as examples. Autophagy's roles include the remodeling during terminal differentiation, the maintenance of a long-lived cell type, and the regulation of the balance between self-renewal and quiescence in stem-like cells. We discuss and compare the mechanistic roles of autophagy, such as prevention of apoptosis, supply of energy metabolites and metabolic adaption, and selective degradation of organelles and of regulatory factors.

38810118	Engineering Efferocytosis-Mimicking Nanovesicles to Regulate Joint Anti-Inflammation and Peripheral Immunosuppression for Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial joints and the dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood. Therefore, an optimal treatment strategy should aim to eliminate the inflammatory response in the joints and simultaneously restore the immune tolerance of Tregs in peripheral blood. Accordingly, we developed an efferocytosis-mimicking nanovesicle that contains three functional factors for immunomodulating of efferocytosis, including "find me" and "eat me" signals for professional (macrophage) or non-professional phagocytes (T lymphocyte), and "apoptotic metabolite" for metabolite digestion. We showed that efferocytosis-mimicking nanovesicles targeted the inflamed joints and spleen of mice with collagen-induced arthritis, further recruiting and selectively binding to macrophages and T lymphocytes to induce M2 macrophage polarization and Treg differentiation and T helper cell 17 (Th17) recession. Under systemic administration, the efferocytosis-mimicking nanovesicles effectively maintained the pro-inflammatory M1/anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage balance in joints and the Treg/Th17 imbalance in peripheral blood to prevent RA progression. This study demonstrates the potential of efferocytosis-mimicking nanovesicles for RA immunotherapy.

21660048	Autophagy promotes T-cell survival through degradation of proteins of the cell death machinery.	Autophagy is implicated in regulating cell death in activated T cells, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that inhibition of autophagy via Beclin 1 gene deletion in T cells leads to rampant apoptosis in these cells upon TCR stimulation. Beclin 1-deficient mice fail to mount autoreactive T-cell responses and are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Compared with Th17 cells, Th1 cells are much more susceptible to cell death upon Beclin 1 deletion. Cell death proteins are highly increased in Beclin 1-deficient T cells and inhibition of caspases and genetic deletion of Bim reverse apoptosis. In addition, p62/sequestosome 1 binds to caspase-8 but does not control levels of procaspase-8 or other cell death-related proteins. These results establish a direct role of autophagy in inhibiting the programmed cell death through degradation of apoptosis proteins in activated T cells.

37738689	Depletion of mTOR ameliorates CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cell pyroptosis by promoting autophagy activity in septic mice.	A reduction in the number of CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cells is a central part of the immunosuppression phase of sepsis and leads to impaired immune defense ability and increased mortality. Pyroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death, was confirmed to be an important mechanism of lymphocytopenia in a lot of human diseases and is under the regulation of autophagy. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is closely related to CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T-cell survival. Whether the mTOR pathway influences CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cell pyroptosis by regulating autophagy remains unknown. In this study, a septic mouse model was developed using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to explore the degree of pyroptosis and autophagy of CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cells. T-cell-specific mTOR/TSC1-knockout mice were used to investigate the role of mTOR pathway in the regulation of CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cell pyroptosis. Bafilomycin, a specific autophagy inhibitor, was used to verify the regulatory effect of autophagy on pyroptosis in septic mice. We observed aggravated pyroptosis in CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cells in CLP mice accompanied by impaired autophagy activity and an overactivated mTOR signaling pathway. Depletion of mTOR relieved autophagy deficiency and reduced the proportion of pyroptotic CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cells. In T-cell-specific mTOR-knockout mice treated with bafilomycin, the protective effect of mTOR depletion vanished. This indicated that autophagy negatively regulates CD<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> T cell pyroptosis, which is under the control of the mTOR pathway. Taken together, our findings emphasize the importance of pyroptosis in sepsis-induced lymphopenia and reveal the regulatory effects of the mTOR pathway and the role of autophagy in this regulation.

33421383	Caloric Restriction Promotes Immunometabolic Reprogramming Leading to Protection from Tuberculosis.	There is a strong relationship between metabolic state and susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, with energy metabolism setting the basis for an exaggerated immuno-inflammatory response, which concurs with MTB pathogenesis. Herein, we show that controlled caloric restriction (CR), not leading to malnutrition, protects susceptible DBA/2 mice against pulmonary MTB infection by reducing bacterial load, lung immunopathology, and generation of foam cells, an MTB reservoir in lung granulomas. Mechanistically, CR induced a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, and decreased both fatty acid oxidation and mTOR activity associated with induction of autophagy in immune cells. An integrated multi-omics approach revealed a specific CR-induced metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signature leading to reduced lung damage and protective remodeling of lung interstitial tightness able to limit MTB spreading. Our data propose CR as a feasible immunometabolic manipulation to control MTB infection, and this approach offers an unexpected strategy to boost immunity against MTB.

38225245	Apoptosis-mediated ADAM10 activation removes a mucin barrier promoting T cell efferocytosis.	Efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells in general, and T cells in particular, is required for tissue and immune homeostasis. Transmembrane mucins are extended glycoproteins highly expressed in the cell glycocalyx that function as a barrier to phagocytosis. Whether and how mucins may be regulated during cell death to facilitate efferocytic corpse clearance is not well understood. Here we show that normal and transformed human T cells express a subset of mucins which are rapidly and selectively removed from the cell surface during apoptosis. This process is mediated by the ADAM10 sheddase, the activity of which is associated with XKR8-catalyzed flipping of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Mucin clearance enhances uptake of apoptotic T cells by macrophages, confirming mucins as an enzymatically-modulatable barrier to efferocytosis. Together these findings demonstrate a glycocalyx regulatory pathway with implications for therapeutic intervention in the clearance of normal and transformed apoptotic T cells.

33692788	Reduced Expression of Autophagy Markers and Expansion of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Correlate With Poor T Cell Response in Severe COVID-19 Patients.	Widespread coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is causing pneumonia, respiratory and multiorgan failure in susceptible individuals. Dysregulated immune response marks severe COVID-19, but the immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, which is hampering the development of efficient treatments. Here we analyzed ~140 parameters of cellular and humoral immune response in peripheral blood of 41 COVID-19 patients and 16 age/gender-matched healthy donors by flow-cytometry, quantitative PCR, western blot and ELISA, followed by integrated correlation analyses with ~30 common clinical and laboratory parameters. We found that lymphocytopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (n=20) strongly affects T, NK and NKT cells, but not B cells and antibody production. Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN-纬 production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells. The latter phenomenon was followed by lower interferon responsive factor (IRF)-8 and autophagy-related genes expressions, and the expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Intriguingly, PD-L1-, ILT-3-, and IDO-1-expressing monocytic MDSC were the dominant producers of IL-6 and IL-10, which correlated with the increased inflammation and accumulation of regulatory B and T cell subsets in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, down-regulated IRF-8 and autophagy-related genes expression, and the expansion of MDSC subsets could play critical roles in dysregulating T cell response in COVID-19, which could have large implications in diagnostics and design of novel therapeutics for this disease.

Here we summarize the mechanisms by which glutamine metabolism regulates Th17/Treg cell fate.

21512143	IFN-纬 inhibits gastric carcinogenesis by inducing epithelial cell autophagy and T-cell apoptosis.	IFN-纬 mediates responses to bacterial infection and autoimmune disease, but it is also an important tumor suppressor. It is upregulated in the gastric mucosa by chronic Helicobacter infection; however, whether it plays a positive or negative role in inflammation-associated gastric carcinogenesis is unexplored. To study this question, we generated an H(+)/K(+)-ATPase-IFN-纬 transgenic mouse that overexpresses murine IFN-纬 in the stomach mucosa. In contrast to the expected proinflammatory role during infection, we found that IFN-纬 overexpression failed to induce gastritis and instead inhibited gastric carcinogenesis induced by interleukin-1beta (IL-1尾) and/or Helicobacter infection. Helper T cell (Th) 1 and Th17 immune responses were inhibited by IFN-纬 through Fas induction and apoptosis in CD4 T cells. IFN-纬 also induced autophagy in gastric epithelial cells through increased expression of Beclin-1. Finally, in the gastric epithelium, IFN-纬 also inhibited IL-1尾- and Helicobacter-induced epithelial apoptosis, proliferation, and Dckl1(+) cell expansion. Taken together, our results suggest that IFN-纬 coordinately inhibits bacterial infection and carcinogenesis in the gastric mucosa by suppressing putative gastric progenitor cell expansion and reducing epithelial cell apoptosis via induction of an autophagic program.

36137312	Prospect of ULK1 modulators in targeting regulatory T cells.	Regulatory T (Treg) cells play an instrumental role in coordinating immune homeostasis via potent inhibitory effects. Defects in Treg cells lead to autoimmunity, but an overwhelming proportion of Treg cells encourages cancer progression. Hence, targeting Treg cells has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating disease severity. Recent studies have revealed that kinases are a critical component for tuning the fate of Treg cells, but the entire network of Treg-modulating kinases is still unclear. Here, we propose that the autophagy-activating UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is a candidate for Treg cell modulation. While accumulating evidence has highlighted the role of autophagy-related kinases in Treg cells, the ULK1-Treg cell axis is yet to be examined. In this review, we predicted the potential role of ULK1 in Treg cell modulation. Furthermore, we summarized current ULK1 activators and inhibitors that can be investigated as Treg-targeting strategies, which might have beneficial outcomes in autoimmunity and cancer.

26910010	The autophagy gene Atg16l1 differentially regulates Treg and TH2 cells to control intestinal inflammation.	A polymorphism in the autophagy gene Atg16l1 is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, it remains unclear how autophagy contributes to intestinal immune homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintenance of balanced CD4(+) T cell responses in the intestine. Selective deletion of Atg16l1 in T cells in mice resulted in spontaneous intestinal inflammation that was characterized by aberrant type 2 responses to dietary and microbiota antigens, and by a loss of Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Specific ablation of Atg16l1 in Foxp3(+) Treg cells in mice demonstrated that autophagy directly promotes their survival and metabolic adaptation in the intestine. Moreover, we also identify an unexpected role for autophagy in directly limiting mucosal TH2 cell expansion. These findings provide new insights into the reciprocal control of distinct intestinal TH cell responses by autophagy, with important implications for understanding and treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.

38186269	TRPM2-dependent autophagy inhibition exacerbates oxidative stress-induced CXCL16 secretion by keratinocytes in vitiligo.	Vitiligo is a depigmented skin disease due to the destruction of melanocytes. Under oxidative stress, keratinocyte-derived chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 16 (CXCL16) plays a critical role in recruiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which kill melanocytes. Autophagy serves as a protective cell survival mechanism and impairment of autophagy has been linked to increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines. However, the role of autophagy in the secretion of CXCL16 under oxidative stress has not been investigated. Herein, we initially found that autophagy was suppressed in both keratinocytes of vitiligo lesions and keratinocytes exposed to oxidative stress in vitro. Autophagy inhibition also promoted CXCL16 secretion. Furthermore, upregulated transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 2 (TRPM2) functioned as an upstream oxidative stress sensor to inhibit autophagy. Moreover, TRPM2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx activated calpain to shear autophagy related 5 (Atg5) and Atg12-Atg5 conjugate formation was blocked to inhibit autophagy under oxidative stress. More importantly, Atg5 downregulation enhanced the binding of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to the CXCL16 promoter region by activating Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), thus promoting CXCL16 secretion. These findings suggested that TRPM2-restrained autophagy promotes CXCL16 secretion via the Atg5-TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway under oxidative stress. Inhibition of TRPM2 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of vitiligo. 漏 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

37894897	The Role of ncRNAs in the Immune Dysregulation of Preeclampsia.	The main complications causing practically 75% of all maternal deaths are severe bleeding, infections, and high blood pressure during pregnancy (preeclampsia (PE) and eclampsia). The usefulness of ncRNAs as clinical biomarkers has been explored in an extensive range of human diseases including pregnancy-related diseases such as PE. Immunological dysregulation show that the Th1/17:Th2/Treg ratio is "central and causal" to PE. However, there is evidence of the involvement of placenta-expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in the immunological regulation of crucial processes of placenta development and function during pregnancy. Abnormal expression of these molecules is related to immune physiopathological processes that occur in PE. Therefore, this work aims to describe the importance of miRNAs and lncRNAs in immune dysregulation in PE. Interestingly, multiple ncRNAS are involved in the immune dysregulation of PE participating in type 1 immune response regulation, immune microenvironment regulation in placenta promoting inflammatory factors, trophoblast cell invasion in women with Early-Onset PE (EOPE), placental development, and angiogenesis, promotion of population of M1 and M2, proliferation, invasion, and migration of placental trophoblast cells, and promotion of invasion and autophagy through vias such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, VEGF/VEGFR1, and TLR9/STAT3.

25385065	Roles of autophagy in HIV infection.	Autophagy is a major cellular pathway, which at basal levels regulates and maintains the cytoplasmic environment through the capture, isolation and digestion of intracellular materials in a specialized structure called an autophagosome. The unique ability of autophagy to degrade large targets, such as damaged and surplus organelles, intracellular microbes and protein aggregates, has made it a prime focus in inflammation and microbial research. Indeed, autophagy has been shown to be involved in a number of infectious and inflammatory pathologies, by which it may confer protection against intracellular microbes, be targeted by microbes for evasion or be hijacked for microbe biogenesis. In addition, autophagy helps regulate the intracellular and global immune response to both extracellular and intracellular pathogens. Here we review the current literature on the interactions between autophagy and HIV among different immune cells and discuss new research that re-emphasizes the role of inflammation in HIV-mediated CD4(+) T cell death.

27446072	The Mucosal Immune System and Its Regulation by Autophagy.	The gastrointestinal tract presents a unique challenge to the mucosal immune system, which has to constantly monitor the vast surface for the presence of pathogens, while at the same time maintaining tolerance to beneficial or innocuous antigens. In the intestinal mucosa, specialized innate and adaptive immune components participate in directing appropriate immune responses toward these diverse challenges. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that the process of autophagy influences several aspects of mucosal immune responses. Initially described as a "self-eating" survival pathway that enables nutrient recycling during starvation, autophagy has now been connected to multiple cellular responses, including several aspects of immunity. Initial links between autophagy and host immunity came from the observations that autophagy can target intracellular bacteria for degradation. However, subsequent studies indicated that autophagy plays a much broader role in immune responses, as it can impact antigen processing, thymic selection, lymphocyte homeostasis, and the regulation of immunoglobulin and cytokine secretion. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of mucosal immune cells and discuss how autophagy influences many aspects of their physiology and function. We focus on cell type-specific roles of autophagy in the gut, with a particular emphasis on the effects of autophagy on the intestinal T cell compartment. We also provide a perspective on how manipulation of autophagy may potentially be used to treat mucosal inflammatory disorders.		2016	Frontiers in immunology
34214903	The lncRNA PVT1 regulates autophagy in regulatory T cells to suppress heart transplant rejection in mice by targeting miR-146a.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are indispensable for the maintenance of immune tolerance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the interaction of the lncRNA PVT1 and miR-146a on Treg autophagy and reveal the mechanism to alleviate transplant rejection. PVT1 and miR-146a expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatic analysis and methylation profiling were used to determine the relationship between PVT1 and miR-146a. Altered autophagic status in Tregs was detected by western blotting. The effect of autophagy on Treg function was assessed in cell coculture in vitro and in animal models. Our results showed that PVT1 expression was reduced in Tregs during rejection and negatively correlated with miR-146a expression. Higher PVT1 expression was associated with higher autophagy in Tregs. Further, highly autophagic Tregs had stronger inhibitory effects on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro, prolonged allograft survival and alleviated rejection in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that overexpression of PVT1 enhanced TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 expression by directly targeting miR-146a. MiR-146a overexpression reversed PVT1-induced Treg autophagy and inhibited PVT1-induced TRAF6 expression. The present study shows a novel regulatory pathway of the autophagy program that comprises PVT1, miR-146a, and TRAF6.

Macrophage and murine studies showed that CS and nicotine impair host-protective immune cells against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)</i> infection. While CS and nicotine may activate T regulatory cells (Tregs), little is known about how CS may affect these immunosuppressive cells with <i>MTB</i> infection.

22266972	Splenocyte apoptosis and autophagy is mediated by interferon regulatory factor 1 during murine endotoxemia.	Sepsis-induced lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis contributes to immunosuppression, which results in an inability to eradicate the primary infection as well as a propensity to acquire new, secondary infections. Another cellular process, autophagy, is also activated in immune cells and plays a protective role. In the present study, we demonstrate that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) regulates both immune cell apoptosis and autophagy in a murine endotoxemia model. Interferon regulatory factor 1 is activated at an early phase through a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88-independent manner in splenocytes. Furthermore, IRF-1 knockout (KO) mice are protected from a lethal endotoxemia model. This protection is associated with decreased apoptosis and increased autophagy in splenocytes. Interferon regulatory factor 1 KO mice experience decreased apoptotic cell loss, especially in CD4鈦?T lymphocytes and myeloid antigen-presenting cells. Meanwhile, IRF-1 KO mice demonstrate increased autophagy and improved mitochondrial integrity. This increased autophagy in KO mice is attributable, at least in part, to deactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin/P70S6 signaling--a main negative regulator of autophagy. Therefore, we propose a novel role for IRF-1 in regulating both apoptosis and autophagy in splenocytes in the setting of endotoxemia with IRF-1 promoting apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy.

32060137	Tris DBA Ameliorates Accelerated and Severe Lupus Nephritis in Mice by Activating Regulatory T Cells and Autophagy and Inhibiting the NLRP3 Inflammasome.	Tris (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Tris DBA), a small-molecule palladium complex, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and proliferation in pancreatic cancer, lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. In the current study, we examined the therapeutic effects of Tris DBA on glomerular cell proliferation, renal inflammation, and immune cells. Treatment of accelerated and severe lupus nephritis (ASLN) mice with Tris DBA resulted in improved renal function, albuminuria, and pathology, including measurements of glomerular cell proliferation, cellular crescents, neutrophils, fibrinoid necrosis, and tubulointerstitial inflammation in the kidneys as well as scoring for glomerulonephritis activity. The treated ASLN mice also showed significantly decreased glomerular IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits. Furthermore, the compound was able to 1) inhibit bone marrow-derived dendritic cell-mediated T cell functions and reduce serum anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels; 2) differentially regulate autophagy and both the priming and activation signals of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and 3) suppress the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Tris DBA improved ASLN in mice through immunoregulation by blunting the MAPK (ERK, JNK)-mediated priming signal of the NLRP3 inflammasome and by regulating the autophagy/NLRP3 inflammasome axis. These results suggest that the pure compound may be a drug candidate for treating the accelerated and deteriorated type of lupus nephritis.

26369701	Negative prognostic impact of regulatory T cell infiltration in surgically resected esophageal cancer post-radiochemotherapy.	Ever accumulating evidence indicates that the long-term effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy largely depend on the induction (or restoration) of an anticancer immune response. Here, we investigated this paradigm in the context of esophageal carcinomas treated by neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy, in a cohort encompassing 196 patients. We found that the density of the FOXP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltrate present in the residual tumor (or its scar) correlated with the pathological response (the less Tregs the more pronounced was the histological response) and predicted cancer-specific survival. In contrast, there was no significant clinical impact of the frequency of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. At difference with breast or colorectal cancer, a loss-of-function allele of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) improved cancer-specific survival of patients with esophageal cancer. While a loss-of-function allele of purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2RX7) failed to affect cancer-specific survival, its presence did correlate with an increase in Treg infiltration. Altogether, these results corroborate the notion that the immunosurveillance seals the fate of patients with esophageal carcinomas treated with conventional radiochemotherapy.
